<h2 id=""returning-to-the-uk"">Returning to the UK</h2>

<p>When you return, you must follow the <a href=""/uk-border-control"">rules for entering the UK</a>.</p>

<p>You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements.  You should contact local authorities for <a rel=""external"" href=""https://eody.gov.gr/en/"">information on testing facilities</a>.</p>

<h3 id=""be-prepared-for-your-plans-to-change"">Be prepared for your plans to change</h3>

<p>No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.</p>

<h3 id=""what-to-do-if-you-test-positive-while-in-greece"">What to do if you test positive while in Greece</h3>

<p>If you test positive for COVID-19 while in Greece you must self-isolate for 10 days from the date of the positive test result.  If you are symptomatic you must continue to self-isolate until you have shown no symptoms for three days. At the end of this period you will need to take an RAT (antigen test). If the result is positive you should take a further test 48 hours later. You can end your self-isolation once you have a negative RAT (antigen test) result.</p>

<p>The above guidance does not apply in the case of strains of special interest or variants under surveillance. These cases will be assessed by the EMEA (Greek health authority) and appropriate instructions will be given.</p>

<p>Depending on the circumstances, you may be able to self-isolate in your current accommodation, or Greek authorities will ask you to self-isolate in a state provided quarantine hotel. The expense of the accommodation in quarantine hotels is covered by the Greek state. Local authorities will be able to offer further advice on self-isolation requirements.</p>

<p>If you do not self-isolate or quarantine when required you may be fined by the Hellenic Police.  The fine could be as much as €5000.  You should comply with any requirement to self-isolate or quarantine.</p>

<p>Plan ahead and make sure you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>can access money</li>
  <li>understand what your insurance will cover</li>
  <li>can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=""quarantine-hotels"">Quarantine hotels</h3>

<p>If you test positive for COVID-19 you may have to enter a quarantine hotel. The UK government will not cover mandatory quarantine costs for British nationals. In Greece, the Greek authorities will pay the cost of your quarantine.</p>

<p>EHIC or GHIC cards can not be used to cover any additional expenses you incur whilst staying in a quarantine hotel. Make sure you have access to funds to cover the costs or take out insurance, checking the policy has adequate cover.</p>

<p>If you have or are entitled to an EHIC or GHIC and you need medical treatment while staying at a quarantine hotel, the UK government will fund treatment as usual through the EHIC/GHIC scheme.</p>

<p>Find out more from the NHS website about <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/"">EHIC and GHIC healthcare cover abroad</a>.</p>

<h2 id=""wearing-a-mask"">Wearing a mask</h2>

<p>At present, it is mandatory to wear a mask in all indoor public places, and crowded outdoor spaces, in all areas of Greece.</p>

<h2 id=""public-spaces-and-services"">Public spaces and services</h2>

<p>All restrictions remain under regular review. In Regional Units (περιφερειακές ενότητες) where the spread of COVID-19 is particularly high and hospital capacity is limited, restrictions may be tighter or re-imposed with limited notice. Check the latest local guidance and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>

<p>Only the most relevant measures to travellers are included below. You should keep up-to-date by checking this page regularly, and following local announcements.</p>

<p>As restrictions may vary, you should <a rel=""external"" href=""https://covid19.gov.gr/covid-map-en/"">check the latest local guidance</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Proof of vaccination is required to enter public spaces such as shops, restaurants (indoor and outdoor) and museums. You should be prepared to demonstrate your proof of vaccination when asked. If you are not fully vaccinated (including children), see <a href=""/foreign-travel-advice/greece/coronavirus#unvaccinated-in-greece"">Unvaccinated in Greece</a>;</li>
  <li>You must use a facemask in all indoor public and communal spaces, including work-places and on public transport;</li>
  <li>Restricted numbers are in place for churches and religious services;</li>
  <li>Unless all passengers are members of the same family, a maximum of 3 persons are permitted to travel in a taxi or other private vehicle with up to 7 seats, or 4 persons in a private vehicle with up to 9 seats;</li>
</ul>

<p>Greece will accept the UK’s <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/demonstrating-your-covid-19-status"">proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record</a>.  If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if domestic certification is required.  Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.</p>

<h3 id=""unvaccinated-in-greece"">Unvaccinated in Greece</h3>

<p>If you have not been fully vaccinated or do not have proof of recovery from COVID19:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Travel by aeroplane, train and bus is allowed subject to either a certified negative PCR test in the last 72 hours before the scheduled time of arrival at destination, or to a certified rapid (antigen) test within 48 hours of scheduled arrival at destination;</li>
  <li>You will not be allowed to participate in sports, or enter stadiums;</li>
  <li>You must present a negative rapid test, taken up to 48 hours before entry, to visit public spaces including shops, restaurants, nightclubs, bars, cinemas, theatres, museums, and archaeological sites;</li>
  <li>Failure to comply with these rules may be met with fines of up to €5,000</li>
  <li>Unvaccinated children (between the ages 4 and 18) require a negative self-test to enter public spaces such as shops, restaurants (indoor and outdoor) and museums</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=""travel-in-greece"">Travel in Greece</h2>

<p>Travel within Greece between Regional Units is permitted subject to adherence to public health measures as outlined above. You must wear a mask at all times on all public transport.</p>

<p>If you are travelling via ferry, you will need to complete a health questionnaire and hand it to the ferry operator before boarding. The necessary forms will be provided by the operator: you should contact them directly if you need further information. Temperature checks may also be carried out before boarding.</p>

<p>Cross-regional travel is allowed for mainland Greece and the islands of Lefkada, Evia and Salamina (use of self-tests ahead of travel is strongly recommended but is not mandatory).</p>

<p>Cross-regional travel by air and sea to the rest of Greece is permitted for those aged 12 and above but only with either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proof of vaccination and 14 days since second dose; or</li>
  <li>a negative result from a PCR test carried out up to 72 hours prior to travel; or</li>
  <li>a negative result from a certified rapid test up to 48 hours before travel; or</li>
</ul>

<p>Children aged 5 to 11, can travel with a negative self-test taken up to 24 hours before the scheduled travel time.</p>

<p>If you are travelling by internal (domestic) flights, specific measures relating to check-in, baggage allowances and other details are in place to reduce the spread of coronavirus. You should check with your operator directly for further detail.</p>

<h2 id=""accommodation"">Accommodation</h2>

<p>All hotels are permitted to open, and other types of accommodation, including e.g. Airbnb, private rentals and hostels, are also available. However, you should note that many operators are likely to reduce their offer and close some accommodation during the winter months, particularly in light of measures put in place by the Greek authorities to fight the spread of COVID-19. You should check directly with your accommodation provider in case of related concerns.</p>

<h2 id=""healthcare-in-greece"">Healthcare in Greece</h2>

<p>If you think you have symptoms, including a fever or respiratory difficulties such as shortness of breath or a cough, you should avoid visiting local health facilities, but contact a doctor remotely to see whether a test is recommended. There is likely to be a cost associated with this, for call out, examination and testing, which you will have to pay.</p>

<p>If you are staying in a hotel or resort, your accommodation provider will have a list of private doctors that they will call to assess your symptoms and conduct a COVID-19 test.</p>

<p>If you have arranged your own accommodation you can find details of English speaking, private doctors on <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medical-facilities"">our list of healthcare providers</a>.</p>

<p>If you are tested and the result is positive, the Greek authorities will ask you to quarantine until advised otherwise. You may be able to remain in your existing accommodation, or be required to transfer into a state hospital or other government-provided accommodation. Costs related to transfer to alternative accommodation and treatment at state healthcare facilities will be covered by the Greek Government. The nature of your accommodation may differ from the specifications of your pre-booked hotel, villa or other place of stay. Depending on local arrangements, travellers in groups may be required to stay in separate accommodation (e.g. if a sufficient number of rooms is not available in one venue, your group may be spread across different accommodation locations).</p>

<h2 id=""covid-19-vaccines-if-you-live-in-greece"">COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Greece</h2>

<p>Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Greece announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/greece/email-signup"">email notifications</a> when this page is updated.</p>

<p>The Greek national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and uses the AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Janssen (Johnson &amp; Johnson) and Moderna vaccines. British nationals resident in Greece are eligible for vaccination. You can get more information on the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://emvolio.gov.gr/en"">Greek National Vaccination Programme</a>. You can register online through the website or get help registering at any pharmacy in Greece. The Greek authorities are aware of issues registering for those who don’t hold AMKA numbers, and are currently working to implement a solution. You should continue to check the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://emvolio.gov.gr/en/pamka"">Greek National Vaccination Programme</a> (available in Greek and in English) for the latest information, or email <a href=""mailto:support.gov@gsis.gr"">support.gov@gsis.gr</a></p>

<p>Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-vaccines-if-you-live-abroad"">COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re a British national living in Greece, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.</p>

<p>If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Greece, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and to the UK and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations.

<p>If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your <a href=""/world/embassies"">nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate</a>. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.</p>

","<h2 id=""strikes-and-demonstrations"">Strikes and demonstrations</h2>

<p>Demonstrations take place regularly around major squares in central Athens, in particular Syntagma Square. Nationwide strikes and protests can occur at any time and may disrupt road/air/sea travel and cause delays/diversions at border crossings. You should follow local media reports and check with your travel operator. You should avoid large crowds and demonstrations. Some demonstrations in the past have turned violent.</p>

<p>Road closures are common in Athens and are not always announced in advance. Demonstrations can be called at short notice, but there are certain dates on which demonstrations traditionally occur: 1 May, 17 November, and 6 December.</p>

<h2 id=""crime"">Crime</h2>

<p>Most visits to Greece are trouble-free, but theft of passports, wallets and handbags are common on the metro and in crowded tourist places, particularly in central Athens. Leave valuables in a safe place at your hotel or apartment and carry a photocopy of your passport with you. You should maintain at least the same level of personal security awareness as in the UK.</p>

<p>When driving on holiday, keep your valuables out of sight and lock your vehicle at all times. Always park in a well-lit area or secure car park. Be alert to car crime.</p>

<p>Personal attacks, including sexual assault and rape, are generally rare in Greece. There have been incidents involving British nationals in some holiday resorts frequented by large numbers of youth tourists. In some cases the alleged attackers were also British nationals. In many cases excessive drinking by either the victim or the offender preceded the incident. There have been some racially motivated attacks, mostly but not restricted to inner-city areas.</p>

<p>Alcohol, drugs and use of nitrous oxide can lead to you being less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment. Drinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK. We recommended only purchasing branded and labelled drinks.</p>

<h2 id=""road-travel"">Road travel</h2>

<p>See the <a rel=""external"" href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/going_abroad/index_en.htm"">European Commission</a>, <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.theaa.com/motoring_advice/overseas/countrybycountry.html"">AA</a> and <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.rac.co.uk/travel/driving-abroad/countries/greece/"">RAC</a> guides on driving in Greece.</p>

<p>In 2019 there were 696 road deaths in Greece (source: <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/ras52-international-comparisons"">Department for Transport</a>). This equates to 6.5 road deaths per 100,000 of population and compares to the UK average of 2.7 road deaths per 100,000 of population in 2019.</p>

<p>If you are planning to drive in Greece, see information on <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad"">Driving Abroad</a>.</p>

<h3 id=""licences-and-documents"">Licences and documents</h3>

<p>You can drive in Greece with a UK driving licence.</p>

<p>You should <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/driving-in-the-eu-from-1-january-2021"">read our guidance on driving in the EU from 1 January 2021</a>.</p>

<h3 id=""driving-a-british-car-abroad"">Driving a British car abroad</h3>

<p>You may need a GB sticker or a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. From 28 September UK stickers will replace GB stickers. Check the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/displaying-number-plates/flags-symbols-and-identifiers"">GOV.UK Displaying number plates website</a> for more information on what to do if you are driving outside the UK before, on or after 28 September 2021.</p>

<h3 id=""road-safety"">Road safety</h3>

<p>Make sure any vehicle you hire is in good condition and check that you’re insured. When renting mopeds or quad bikes, insurance sold by the hire company usually only provides third party insurance, which only covers the cost of damage to another vehicle. Any damage sustained to the rental vehicle in many cases may need to be paid for by you, or you may face arrest if you do not pay and the hire company decide to press charges.</p>

<h3 id=""quad-biking"">Quad biking</h3>

<p>Quad biking is considered an extreme sport and carries the risk of serious injury or death. Specific travel insurance to cover quad bike rental is essential to avoid you having to pay the costs of private health care and/or repatriation to the UK. Always take care to read the details of your insurance cover before you travel on holiday, paying particular attention to the small print and exclusions on your insurance policy.</p>

<p>If you do rent a quad bike, choose a category in accordance with your driving licence and age.  Drivers and passengers must wear helmets.  Failure to do so may invalidate your insurance and if stopped, you will be fined and your licence taken from you.
If you intend to hire a moped you will need a valid driving licence with at least category A1 - ‘light motorcycle’. Category P, which is valid in the UK for driving mopeds up to 50cc, is not valid in Greece.</p>

<h2 id=""sensitive-locations"">Sensitive locations</h2>

<p>You shouldn’t approach or take photos or videos of military installations, vehicles or buildings at any time. The Greek authorities will arrest and possibly prosecute anyone doing so. Certain border areas are also militarily sensitive. Although you can visit these areas, you should avoid taking photos or video footage.</p>

<h2 id=""water-sports-and-swimming"">Water sports and swimming</h2>

<p>Follow local advice if jellyfish are present.</p>

<p>If you are considering taking part in water sports activities, do so through a licensed water sports centre and make sure paperwork is completed before starting the activity. Check the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://safewatersports.com/"">Safe Water Sports</a> website for more information.</p>

<p>However inviting the blue waters may be, make sure you follow any warning signs, adhere to instructions from lifeguards and observe the flag indicators on beaches.</p>

<h2 id=""political-situation"">Political situation</h2>

<p>Since 1974, Greece has been a stable parliamentary democracy, with its head of state elected by the Parliament. It joined the European Union in 1981. Greece is recovering from a long-running economic crisis and its financial system is fragile. Greece has made positive steps in reducing its debts. Following the latest economic review, international creditors have released funds, but there remains a risk of further economic difficulties and related demonstrations.</p>

<h2 id=""migration"">Migration</h2>

<p>Since 2015, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of migrants and refugees arriving on Greek islands, including Lesvos, Kos and Samos, and seeking to continue their journey via Greece to other EU countries. The flows have recently reduced significantly. At present there are no reports of any specific risks to British nationals visiting these islands or at border crossing points.</p>
","<p>Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Greece. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreigners.</p>

<div class=""example"">
<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/"">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad"">global threat from terrorism</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>High profile British interests in Greece should be vigilant and regularly review their security measures.</p>

<p>There have been several attacks involving explosives and automatic weapons against Greek institutions, shopping malls, banks, media offices, diplomatic premises and the police.</p>

<p>British nationals aren’t normally considered a specific target, but attacks could happen in places visited by foreigners.</p>

<p>There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.</p>

","<h3 id=""id-requirements"">ID requirements</h3>
<p>Carry a copy of your passport or other photographic ID which confirms British nationality at all times.</p>

<h3 id=""indecent-behaviour"">Indecent behaviour</h3>
<p>Indecent behaviour, including mooning, is not tolerated. The police will make arrests and the courts are likely to impose heavy fines or prison sentences on people who behave indecently. Some fancy dress costumes may be regarded as offensive and therefore against decency laws.</p>

<h3 id=""drugs-and-alcohol"">Drugs and alcohol</h3>
<p>Don’t become involved with drugs of any kind, and don’t bring drugs - including ‘class C’ drugs - from the UK. Possession of even small quantities can lead to a long prison sentence.</p>

<p>Alcohol, drugs and use of nitrous oxide can make you less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment.</p>

<p>The Greek authorities are clamping down on the sale of nitrous oxide as it is illegal to buy or sell for recreational use in Greece. You will be liable for arrest as well as a possible fine. You should also be aware of the health risks associated with its use.</p>

<p>Driving any vehicle while over the legal drinking limit can result in a heavy fine and/or imprisonment.</p>

<h3 id=""taking-food-and-drink-into-the-eu"">Taking food and drink into the EU</h3>

<p>You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions for medical reasons, for example certain amounts of powdered infant milk, infant food, or pet food required for medical reasons. <a rel=""external"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/animalproducts/personal_imports_en"">Check the rules about taking food and drink into the EU</a> on the European Commission website.</p>

<h3 id=""public-transport"">Public transport</h3>

<p>It’s sometimes necessary to time stamp or validate your ticket on public transport for it to be valid. Check with local providers.</p>

<h3 id=""purchasing-goods-or-services"">Purchasing goods or services</h3>

<p>Make sure you get a receipt for any goods or services you buy.</p>

<p>Don’t buy any offensive items like pepper spray, knuckledusters or knives with a blade length of 10cm or above. These items are listed as weapons in Greece and fall under the current weapon possession law. You need to have a special licence from the local police authority to carry any weapon otherwise you might face arrest and legal charges. The same applies for knives; you need to have a special licence to carry any knife that is not made for domestic, professional, artistic or hunting use.</p>

<h3 id=""lgbt-travellers"">LGBT travellers</h3>

<p>Same-sex sexual relations are legal in Greece and civil unions between same-sex couples have been legal since 2015. The age of consent of 15 is the same as for partners of the opposite sex. Transgender people are able to change their legal gender. Anti-discrimination and hate speech laws apply to gender identity.</p>

<p>Public attitudes towards homosexuality vary throughout the country; public displays of affection by same-sex couples may be frowned upon, especially in rural areas.</p>

<p>Attitudes are generally much more welcoming in Athens and on many Greek islands, particularly on Lesvos, Mykonos and Skiathos, which are well known for their gay and lesbian scenes. See our <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice"">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT community before you travel.</p>

<h3 id=""smoking"">Smoking</h3>

<p>It’s illegal to smoke in all indoor public places. The penalty for violating this law is a fine of up to €500.</p>

<h3 id=""military-service-obligations"">Military Service obligations</h3>

<p>Men, aged 19 and above, born to a Greek national parent may have military service obligations, regardless of any other nationality they hold. Authorities can prevent you leaving Greece until you complete military service obligations.</p>
","<p>This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.</p>

<p>The authorities in Greece set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact their <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk"">embassy, high commission or consulate</a>. You may also check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and travel documents meet their requirements.</p>

<p>If you are <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-greece-for-work"">travelling to Greece for work</a>, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.</p>

<h2 id=""entry-rules-in-response-to-coronavirus-covid-19"">Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)</h2>

<h3 id=""entry-to-greece"">Entry to Greece</h3>

<p>If you’re travelling from the UK, you will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To have completed a <a rel=""external"" href=""https://travel.gov.gr/#/"">Passenger Locator Form (PLF)</a> before arrival in Greece. The form is required regardless of the means of transport you use to travel to Greece (including by ferry, road, rail or air);</li>
</ul>

<p>You will also need one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test, undertaken within the 72 hour period before arrival into Greece; or</li>
  <li>Proof of a negative COVID-19 rapid antigen test from an authorised laboratory, undertaken within the 48 hour period before your arrival into Greece; or</li>
  <li>Proof of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 at least 14 days before travel (see <a href=""/foreign-travel-advice/greece/entry-requirements#demonstrating"">Demonstrating your COVID-19 status</a>);</li>
  <li>Greece will also accept proof of recovery from COVID-19 for entry purposes. Evidence of a positive COVID-19 PCR test result taken between 30 to 180 days of your travel dates can be used and can be demonstrated via the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-covid-pass#who-can-get-an-nhs-covid-pass-in-england"">NHS COVID Pass</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These requirements are compulsory for all travellers above the age of 12. In addition, arrivals into Greece may be required to undergo a rapid COVID-19 test on arrival. If you test positive on arrival in Greece, you (and those you are travelling with) will have to self-isolate in quarantine hotels provided by the Greek state. The length of time you need to self-isolate depends on your vaccination status. See ‘Coronavirus’ page for details of what to do if you test positive for COVID-19 while in Greece. You should also be aware that if other passengers on your flight, bus, train or ferry later test positive, you may be subject to self-isolation requirements. These will be mandatory and you should comply with the Greek authorities’ requirements.</p>

<p>Check <a rel=""external"" href=""https://travel.gov.gr/#/"">Greek authorities’ advice</a> for further information, including guidance on filling out the Passenger Locator Form and the latest list of countries from which travel to Greece is permitted.</p>

<h3 id=""demonstrating"">Demonstrating your COVID-19 status</h3>

<p>Greece will accept the UK’s <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/demonstrating-your-covid-19-status"">proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record</a>.  If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully.  Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.</p>

<h3 id=""additional-restrictions-on-entry-by-air"">Additional restrictions on entry by air</h3>

<p>Air connections with Greece are liable to suspension or amendment, sometimes at short notice. If you are due to fly to or from Greece, you should contact your airline or operator for the latest information.</p>

<h3 id=""additional-restrictions-on-entry-by-land-borders"">Additional restrictions on entry by land borders</h3>

<p>Greece’s land borders are subject to restrictions at present. Monitor <a rel=""external"" href=""https://travel.gov.gr/#/"">official information from the Greek authorities</a> on any changes to border arrangements. Arrivals must have completed a <a rel=""external"" href=""https://travel.gov.gr/#/"">Passenger Locator Form</a> prior to travel. You should also refer to the ‘Coronavirus’ pages for details of how local or national measures may affect travel across land borders.</p>

<h3 id=""passenger-locator-form"">Passenger Locator Form</h3>

<p>You must <a rel=""external"" href=""https://travel.gov.gr/#/"">complete an online Passenger Locator Form (PLF)</a> before arriving in Greece. The form is in English, and is required whichever way you travel to Greece (including by ferry, road, rail or air). Failure to do so in advance may result in your carrier not allowing you to travel, a 500 Euro fine on arrival or the Greek authorities not allowing you to enter or re-enter the country.</p>

<p>Every traveller, including children, must have their details included on a PLF. If you’re travelling with others outside of your household, you should all complete your own form. If you’re travelling together as a household, the Greek authorities ask for you to complete one form with all adults and children included. You can add additional members of your household at the top of the form before you submit.</p>

<p>Some airlines may require individual PLFs for every traveller over the age of 18 within the same household. Check directly with your airline what you will need to show to be allowed boarding.</p>

<p>Once you have completed the form, you will receive an email with a QR code. When you receive your code, make sure you either print it, or can show it on your mobile phone.
If you are travelling by air to Greece, your airline will ask you to prove that you have completed the PLF form. You should print or show (e.g. on your phone) your email with the QR code you have received. Failure to do so could result in you being refused boarding to the flight.</p>

<p>If you are travelling by ferry to or from Greece, the ferry operator will ask you to complete an additional form (‘Pre Boarding Information’), alongside your PLF. This additional form will be provided by the ferry operator, either via their website, or at booking offices: you should contact them directly if you need further information. Temperature checks may also be carried out before boarding; and it is obligatory to wear masks on all ferries, where capacity is limited to allow for social distancing.</p>

<p>On arrival in Greece, you will need to show your QR code to the Greek authorities. Make sure you have either a printed copy of the code, or can show it on your phone. Failure to provide your PLF form/ QR code will result in a fine or you may be refused entry to Greece.</p>

<h2 id=""regular-entry-requirements"">Regular entry requirements</h2>

<h3 id=""visas"">Visas</h3>

<p>The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you can travel to countries in the  <a rel=""external"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf"">Schengen area</a> for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training</li>
  <li>if you are travelling to Greece and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days</li>
  <li>to stay longer, to work or study, for business or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Greek government’s entry requirements. Check with the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.greekembassy.org.uk/en-gb/"">Greek Embassy</a>  what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you may need</li>
  <li>if you stay in Greece with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit</li>
</ul>

<p>Any time you spent in Greece or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.</p>

<p>At Greek border control, you may need to queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens.</p>

<p>Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Greece as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.</p>

<p>You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.</p>

<p>You may also need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>show a return or onward ticket</li>
  <li>show you have enough money for your stay</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are resident in Greece your passport should not be stamped. You should proactively show your proof of residence as well as your valid passport at Greek border control. For further information, <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-greece#passports-and-travel"">see our Living in Greece guide</a>.</p>

<h3 id=""passport-validity"">Passport validity</h3>

<p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe"">Check your passport is valid</a> for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.</p>

<p>Make sure your passport is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave Greece, or any other Schengen country</li>
  <li>less than 10 years old</li>
</ul>

<p>The 3 months you need when leaving a country must be within 10 years of the passport issue date.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the minimum 3 months needed.</p>

<h3 id=""travelling-with-medication"">Travelling with medication</h3>

<p>According to Greek law, a visitor can bring up to 5 different prescribed medicines for personal use, with a maximum of 2 boxes of each medicine.</p>

<p>Some prescribed and over-the-counter medicines available in the UK, including medication containing codeine, are considered controlled substances in Greece. A doctor’s prescription is required in all cases, which should mention your details, the types of medicine and the condition treated. On arrival, Greek Customs may in some cases require you to obtain permission from the Greek National Organisation of Medicines - if you need to carry more than the permitted number of boxes, for example. The National Organisation of Medicines examines these requests on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>For more information on controlled medicines, contact the Greek National Organisation of Medicines (telephone: 0030 213 2040 285 / 307 / 225, open Monday to Friday, 12pm to 3pm Greece time, or email: <a href=""mailto:relation@eof.gr"">relation@eof.gr</a>).</p>

<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/countries"">National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC)</a> on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/destinations.aspx"">FitForTravel website</a>.</p>

<p>General information on <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/"">travel vaccinations</a> and a <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/travel-health-checklist/"">travel health checklist</a> is available on the NHS website.  You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.</p>

<p>The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on <a rel=""external"" href=""https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad"">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>. For more information on regulations in Greece, see <a href=""/foreign-travel-advice/greece/entry-requirements#travelling-with-medication"">Travelling with medication</a></p>

<p>While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues"">guidance page</a>. Further information is also available from the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/85/travelling-with-mental-health-conditions"">National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC)</a>.</p>

<h3 id=""healthcare"">Healthcare</h3>
<p>You should get a free <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/"">UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) or European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</a> before leaving the UK. If you already have an EHIC it will still be valid as long as it remains in date.</p>

<p>The GHIC or EHIC entitles you to state provided medical treatment that may become necessary during your trip. Any treatment provided is on the same terms as Greek nationals. If you don’t have your EHIC with you or you’ve lost it, you can call the NHS Overseas Healthcare Team on +44 191 218 1999 to get a Provisional Replacement Certificate.</p>

<p>It’s important to take out appropriate travel insurance for your needs. A GHIC or EHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance and you should have both before you travel. It does not cover all health-related costs, for example, medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment and non-urgent treatment. Read more about <a href=""/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance"">what your travel insurance should cover</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re living in Greece, you can also find more information on healthcare for residents in our <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-greece"">Living In Greece</a> guide.</p>

<p>Treatment and facilities are generally good on the mainland, but may be limited on the islands. The standards of nursing and after care, particularly in the public health sector lag behind what is normally acceptable in the UK. The public ambulance service, which will normally respond to any accident, is basic. There are severe shortages of ambulances on some islands.</p>

<p>While pharmacies across the country stock a good supply of medicines, you should make sure you have sufficient medical supplies (including prescription medicines) for the duration of your stay and any unforeseen delays, adequate travel insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment and repatriation.</p>

<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 112 or 166 and ask for an ambulance. If you are referred to a medical facility for treatment you should contact your insurance/medical assistance company immediately.</p>

<h3 id=""diseases"">Diseases</h3>

<p>There is a risk of West Nile virus in Greece. You should consider <a rel=""external"" href=""https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/38/insect-and-tick-bite-avoidance"">preventative measures to minimise exposure to mosquitoes</a>. Visit the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/47/west-nile-virus"">National Travel Health Network and Centre website</a> for more information about the transmission season and advice for travellers.</p>
","<h3 id=""earthquakes"">Earthquakes</h3>

<p>Greece can experience earthquakes and earth tremors. You should familiarise yourself with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake and follow advice given by the local authorities. The Greek General Secretariat for Civil Protection website has advice about <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.civilprotection.gr/en/earthquakes"">what to do before, during and after an earthquake</a>, and issues announcements about ongoing incidents.</p>

<h3 id=""forest-fires"">Forest fires</h3>

<p>Forest fires often occur during the summer months across Greece due to the dry/hot weather.</p>

<p>Forest fires are highly dangerous and unpredictable. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas. Make sure cigarette ends are properly extinguished, and don’t light barbecues. Causing a forest fire is treated as a criminal offence in Greece even if unintentional. If you see a forest fire, call the emergency services on 112.</p>

<p>Forest fires can also cause travel disruption in wider areas. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.emy.gr/emy/en/index_html"">Greek Meteorological Service</a> or <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.emetsoc.org/resources/meteorological-and-hydrological-services/"">European Meteorological Services</a>, follow the advice of local authorities at all times and check with your travel provider for travel updates.</p>

You should follow the advice of local authorities at all times.</p>
","<p>You can withdraw cash using a UK card up to the daily limit imposed by the Greek banking system (usually €600) or the daily limit imposed by your UK card issuer - whichever is the lower amount.</p>

<p>You should be able to pay for retail transactions with debit and credit cards as you would elsewhere, but always check beforehand as not all business hold a machine for processing card payments.</p>

<p>When travelling outside the UK you should take more than one means of payment with you (cash, debit card, credit card).</p>

<p>The <abbr title=""Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office"">FCDO</abbr> travel advice helps you make your own decisions about foreign travel. Your safety is our main concern, but we can’t provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you’re concerned about whether or not it’s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you’re travelling to, together with information from other sources you’ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it’s safe for you to travel.</p>

<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we’ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice"">Read more about how the <abbr title=""Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office"">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>

<p>The Swedish Public Health Agency advises that it is important for everyone to maintain physical distance from other people, both while travelling and at the destination. Public transport is in operation, but frequency and capacity may be limited. The Swedish Public Health agency recommends face masks on public transport during peak hours (on weekdays between 7am to 9am and 4pm to 6pm).</p>

<p>You may need a GB sticker or a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. From 28 September UK stickers will replace GB stickers. Check the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/displaying-number-plates/flags-symbols-and-identifiers"">GOV.UK Displaying number plates website</a> for more information on what to do if you are driving outside the UK before, on or after 28 September 2021.</p>

<h3 id=""driving-regulations"">Driving regulations</h3>
<p>From 1 December to 31 March and when weather conditions are wintry, all Swedish and foreign registered vehicles, both light and heavy, are required by law to have either studded tyres or un-studded friction tyres bearing the following mark, M+S, M-s, M.S, M&amp;S, MS or Mud and Snow.</p>

<p>The road conditions are considered to be wintry when there is snow, ice, slush or frost on any part of the road. The Swedish police decides whether there are wintry conditions on a certain road.</p>

<p>In Sweden everyone travelling in a car is required to wear a seat belt. Children who are shorter than 135cm must use a special protective device – either a baby car seat, child car seat, booster seat or booster cushion.  All long-distance buses are equipped with seat belts, which passengers are required to use by law. Bicycle helmets are mandatory for children under 15 (but not for adult cyclists). It’s illegal to use a mobile phone in your hand when driving.</p>

<h3 id=""visas"">Visas</h3>

<p>The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you can travel to countries in the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf"">Schengen area</a> for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.</li>
  <li>if you are travelling to Sweden and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.</li>
  <li>to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Swedish government’s entry requirements. Check with the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.swedenabroad.se/en/embassies/united-kingdom-london/"">Swedish Embassy</a> what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you may need</li>
  <li>if you stay in Sweden with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit</li>
</ul>

<p>Any time you spent in Sweden or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.</p>

<p>At Swedish border control, you may need to queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens.</p>

<p>Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Sweden as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.</p>

<p>You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.</p>

<p>You may also need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>show a return or onward ticket</li>
  <li>show you have enough money for your stay</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are resident in the Sweden your passport should not be stamped. You should proactively show your proof of residence as well as your valid passport at Swedish border control. For further information, <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-sweden#passports-and-travel"">see our Living in Sweden guide</a>.</p>

<h3 id=""passport-validity"">Passport validity</h3>

<p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe"">Check your passport is valid</a> for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.</p>

<p>Make sure your passport is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave Sweden, or any other Schengen country</li>
  <li>less than 10 years old</li>
</ul>

<p>The 3 months you need when leaving a country must be within 10 years of the passport issue date.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the minimum 3 months needed.</p>

<h3 id=""uk-emergency-travel-documents"">UK Emergency Travel Documents</h3>
<p>UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Sweden.</p>

<h3 id=""travelling-with-children"">Travelling with children</h3>

","<p>Large numbers of British nationals travel successfully and safely in and around the Arctic each year. The Arctic is, however, a vast region, comprising the northerly areas of Canada, Finland, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and Alaska (United States). In addition to reading the specific travel advice for each of these countries, prospective visitors to the Arctic should also consider carefully the potential remoteness of certain destinations from search and rescue, evacuation and medical facilities. Independent travellers are particularly advised to develop contingency arrangements for emergency back-up.</p>

<p>The most popular way of visiting the Arctic is by ship. As some areas of the Arctic -specifically the more northerly and remote regions - can be uncharted and ice-covered, you should check the previous operational experience of cruise and other operators offering travel in the region. You should also consider the on-board medical facilities of cruise ships and talk to cruise operators as appropriate, particularly if you have a pre-existing medical condition.</p>

<p>The eight Arctic States take their international search and rescue obligations very seriously, and have recently signed a binding agreement on search and rescue co-operation in the Arctic.  However, in the highest latitude regions of the Arctic, cruise ships may be operating in relative isolation from other vessels and/or inhabited areas. You should be aware that in these regions, search and rescue response will often need to be dispatched from many hundreds of miles away, and assistance to stranded vessels may take several days to arrive, particularly in bad weather. Search and rescue assets are also likely to offer only basic transport and basic medical care, and are unlikely to be capable of advanced life-support.   Responsible cruise operators should happily provide additional information relevant to the circumstances of the cruise they are offering, and address any concerns you may have.</p>

<p>Consular assistance and support to British nationals in the Arctic will be affected by the capacity of national and local authorities. You should make sure you have adequate travel insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment or potential repatriation.</p>

<h3 id=""be-prepared-for-your-plans-to-change"">Be prepared for your plans to change</h3>

<p>No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.</p>

<p>If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.</p>

<p>Plan ahead and make sure you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>can access money</li>
  <li>understand what your insurance will cover</li>
  <li>can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=""travel-in-thailand"">Travel in Thailand</h2>
<p>Domestic travel options within Thailand are available but remain subject to disease control measures. These may include restrictions on movement between provinces.</p>

<p>If you are taking an internal flight in Thailand, you may be asked to download an app or complete additional travel documentation.</p>

<p>You will be required to wear a face mask and follow other disease control measures when using public transport, including planes, trains, buses and taxis. In some provinces public transport may stop earlier than normal or have less capacity than normal.</p>

<h3 id=""covid-related-restrictions-in-thailand"">COVID-related restrictions in Thailand</h3>
<p>An emergency decree is currently in place. This includes instructions that you must not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enter high risk areas</li>
  <li>hoard essential goods</li>
  <li>attend public gatherings</li>
  <li>propagate false information</li>
</ul>

<p>Until further notice you must also wear a mask in all indoor and outdoor public spaces in Thailand and in vehicles if you are with others. If you do not wear a mask you may have to pay a fine.</p>

<p>The Thai government also advises that you should avoid unnecessary travel and crowded places, and scan the ‘Thai Chana’ QR code where available.</p>

<p>A number of disease control measures at national and local levels are also in place. These include a colour rating for each of Thailand’s 76 provinces based on the number of COVID-19 cases. Restrictions in each province and for movement between provinces depend on the colour rating and any additional local rules, and they may change at any time.</p>

<p>In some provinces measures may include restrictions on dining in restaurants, gathering in groups, closures of shops and curfews. You are advised to follow all preventative and disease control measures to minimise risks and avoid penalties.</p>

<p>Measures change frequently. You should check the current situation with local authorities and the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/thailandprd/videos/620249802706637/"">Thai government’s Facebook page</a> and <a rel=""external"" href=""https://thailand.prd.go.th/main.php?filename=index"">PR website</a>.</p>

<h2 id=""accommodation"">Accommodation</h2>

<p>Hotel and private rental accommodation is available throughout Thailand. However, some hotels remain closed so we advise you to contact hotels directly when booking.</p>

<p>The majority of hotels will ask to take your temperature on arrival and ask you to provide information on your recent travel history and any symptoms you may have related to COVID-19. You may also need to follow other disease control measures.</p>

<p>Some services and facilities in hotels may not be available e.g. leisure facilities.</p>

<p>For contact details for English speaking doctors, <a href=""/government/publications/thailand-list-of-medical-facilities"">visit our list of healthcare providers</a>.</p>

<p>If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should call the Thai COVID-19 Hotline on 1422.</p>

<p>If you need a COVID-19 test, Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health has compiled a <a rel=""external"" href=""https://service.dmsc.moph.go.th/labscovid19/indexen.php"">list of private and government-managed testing facilities</a>.  These will provide you with a test and normally contact you afterwards with the result. Authorities may also contact you as part of their tracing process.</p>

<p>If you test positive for COVID-19 and have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, Thai authorities recommend that you self-isolate at home or in a community setting dedicated to this such as a school or temple, where you can receive appropriate care.  This also applies to school age children. National Health Security Office (NHSO) provides medical support and services for home isolation. To register, you can call the 1330 hotline.</p>

<p>If you have more severe symptoms Thai public health regulations require that you quarantine at either a hospital, hospitel (a repurposed hotel with medical capabilities) or field hospital.</p>

<p>You should ensure that you understand your health care provider’s policies before you take a test as these will include where you quarantine and receive medical care if you test positive.</p>

<p>In areas designated as dark red zones there is increasing pressure on medical services. You may find it difficult to access COVID-19 testing and medical care.</p>

<p>There may also be specific measures in place that impact on maternity services in some hospitals, including quarantine for newborn babies and C-sections as the preferred form of delivery. In most cases, these are recommendations only but in some hospitals they are mandatory. You should ensure you understand your health care provider’s policies so you can make the choices that work best for you.

<h2 id=""covid-19-vaccines-if-you-live-in-thailand"">COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Thailand</h2>

<p>Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live.  As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/thailand/email-signup"">Sign up to get email notifications</a>.</p>

<p>A national vaccination programme is now in progress in Thailand.</p>

<p>Residents of Thailand, including foreigners, can register for a vaccine at any hospital that holds your health records. Registration online and at hospitals that do not hold your records may also be possible. Short and longer-term visitors may not be eligible under this scheme. You can find more information on how to register for vaccines in our <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-thailand#healthcare"">Living in Thailand page</a>.</p>

<p>In many areas there are limited supplies of vaccines and registration and vaccination programmes can change. You should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider in Thailand and check the current situation with local authorities and the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/thailandprd/videos/620249802706637/"">Thai government’s Facebook page</a> and <a rel=""external"" href=""https://thailand.prd.go.th/main.php?filename=index"">PR website</a>.</p>

<p>The only vaccines that are being used in the national programme are AstraZeneca, Sinovac and Pfizer-BioNTech, although others such as Sinopharm may be available privately.</p>

<p>The mixing of vaccines may be offered. In some circumstances, AstraZeneca may be offered as your second dose if Sinovac was your first. Pfizer-BioNTech may also be offered if AstraZeneca was your first. You should seek more information from your local vaccination sites.</p>

<p>When you have received your vaccine, you can register on the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.moph.go.th/index.php/home/app_moph"">“Mor Phrom” application</a> to get the digital vaccine certificate. Instructions can be found on the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/thailandprd/posts/4582050028485042"">PR Thai Government Facebook page</a>.</p>

","<h2 id=""political-situation"">Political situation</h2>
<p>The political situation in Thailand can be volatile.  In recent years, there have been instances of civil and political unrest.  You should avoid any protests, political gatherings, demonstrations or marches.</p>

<p>Lèse-majesté (criticism of the monarchy in any form) is a crime, which can be interpreted broadly and carries a long jail sentence. Some foreign (including British) and Thai journalists, Human Rights Defenders and members of the public have faced criminal charges, including for defamation, sedition, and under the Computer Crimes Act for raising concerns, making political comments, and sharing articles online that could been seen as portraying Thailand negatively or making accusations about individuals.</p>

<h2 id=""crime"">Crime</h2>
<p>If you’re the victim of a crime in Thailand and wish to report it to the Thai police you should do so before leaving the country. If you do not, your case may not be investigated. Be aware that the way the media report crime is different from the UK. Local authorities, including the police, may give detailed press briefings. There have been instances where the victims of crime have been identified and threatened with prosecution by the police for damaging Thailand’s reputation.</p>

<p>Be aware that posting images on social media of people drinking alcohol or wearing inappropriate clothing can result in fines and/or imprisonment both for the person who uploaded the images and the people in them.</p>

<p>Be on your guard against pickpockets and bag snatchers, especially from thieves on motorbikes or when travelling in open transport like tuk tuks. Make sure valuables are kept securely and out of sight. Passengers on buses and trains have had items taken from bags while asleep.</p>

<p>Violent crime, including gun crime, rarely involves foreign tourists, although in 2018 several foreign nationals were victims of gun violence in Bangkok. You should take care when travelling in unfamiliar areas and avoid walking through less travelled areas alone, especially at night.</p>

<p>Don’t hand over your passport to third parties as a guarantee (eg to motorcycle or jet ski rental businesses) as companies may hold on to passports against claimed damage.</p>

<p>Violent sexual assaults and unprovoked attacks have been reported in tourist destinations across Thailand. These are particularly common during Full Moon parties and other similar events and late at night near bars.</p>

<p>Drink spiking and date rapes have been reported in tourist destinations around Thailand, with both male and female victims. Be careful about taking drinks from strangers or leaving your drinks unattended, particularly in Koh Tao, Koh Samui, Pattaya and at the Full Moon party on Koh Phangan.</p>

<p>Alcohol and drugs can lead to you being less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment resulting in accidents, injuries, robbery, assaults and lost travel documents. If you drink, know your limit. Drinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK. Some British nationals in Thailand have suffered severe psychiatric problems because of drug use, resulting in some suicides.</p>

<p>Be aware of the possibility of credit card fraud. Don’t lose sight of your card during transactions. There have been incidents of ATM skimming in Thailand. Where possible use an ATM within a bank and always protect your PIN.</p>

<p>Buying a property in Thailand isn’t straightforward and you should be aware of the risks before making any financial commitments. British people have been caught up in property scams. Several face criminal defamation charges for alleging fraud and malpractice in response to being scammed. The legal process can be lengthy and expensive.</p>

<h2 id=""local-travel"">Local travel</h2>
<p>Due to the ongoing coronavirus situation, unless you qualify for an exemption under the Emergency Decree you should not attempt to cross land borders at present. See <a href=""/foreign-travel-advice/thailand/entry-requirements"">Entry requirements</a></p>

<h3 id=""myanmar-border"">Myanmar border</h3>
<p>There are occasional clashes between the Thai security forces, armed criminal groups and drug traffickers along the Thai/Myanmar border. Outside the main towns, police and military checkpoints are actively manned and travelers may be asked to produce ID.  See the <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.tourismthailand.org/"">Tourism Thailand website</a> and seek advice locally before you travel to this part of the country.</p>

<p>Only cross into <a href=""/foreign-travel-advice/myanmar"">Myanmar</a> at an official border checkpoint, and after obtaining any relevant permissions/visas from the Burmese and Thai authorities.</p>

<h3 id=""cambodian-border"">Cambodian border</h3>
<p>The line of the international border near the Preah Vihear temple was disputed by Cambodia and Thailand. The exact border is still being agreed.</p>

<p>You should take extra care in border areas and follow the instructions of the local authorities. There are unexploded landmines in the border area, you should stay on marked paths especially around Ta Krabey.</p>

<p>Remain alert to the local situation when travelling anywhere near to the border with <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/cambodia"">Cambodia</a>, and at land crossings between the two countries.</p>

<h3 id=""laos-border"">Laos border</h3>
<p>Not all land border crossings into <a href=""/foreign-travel-advice/laos"">Laos</a> are open to foreigners and you may need to get a Laos visa before you arrive to cross the border. Much of the exact border is still being agreed.</p>

<h2 id=""air-travel"">Air travel</h2>
<p>Due to the  coronavirus situation internal and international air travel options remain more limited than previously. If you intend to leave Thailand and need to take a domestic flight to reach your international airport you should check with your provider and plan carefully as travel between provinces is still subject to some limitations. There are two airports in Bangkok: Suvarnabhumi International Airport and Don Mueang Airport.</p>

<p>Occasionally airports (especially in the north of Thailand) can close in March and April caused by poor air quality affecting visibility. You should check with your airline before travelling.</p>

<p>The FCDO can’t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines, but the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn’t necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>

<p>A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the Aviation Safety network.</p>

<h2 id=""road-travel"">Road travel</h2>

<p>There are a high number of road traffic accidents in Thailand especially involving motorcycles. The World Health Organisation (WHO) rates Thailand as the world’s deadliest country for fatalities on motorcycles, citing an average of 5,500  motorcyclist deaths annually.</p>

<p>To drive a car or ride a motorcycle in Thailand, under Thai law you must have the correct licence and appropriate insurance for the category of vehicle you’re using. You will need to apply for a Thai driving licence or, if you already hold a UK licence, an <a href=""/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit"">International Driving Permit</a>. If you drive a car or ride a motorcycle in Thailand without a valid licence, this may invalidate your travel insurance if you have an accident or injury.</p>

<p>Under Thai law, you must wear a helmet when riding motorcycles.</p>

<p>There have been a number of accidents involving overnight coach travel. Seek local advice if you are in any doubt about the safety of your transport provider.</p>

<p>Motorcycles or scooters for hire in beach resorts are often unregistered and can’t be used legally on a public road. Before you hire a vehicle, make sure you’re covered by your travel insurance and check the small print of the lease agreement. Don’t hand over your passport as a guarantee against returning a motorcycle or scooter.</p>

<p>Riding quad-bikes can be dangerous. It is also illegal to drive these on the roads even though they’re available to hire on the roadside.</p>

<h2 id=""rail-travel"">Rail travel</h2>

<p>Due to the coronavirus situation rail travel options may be more limited than previously. If you intend to leave Thailand and need to travel by train to reach your airport you should check with your provider.</p>

<p>There have been a number of train derailments in Thailand. Some have resulted in deaths and injuries.</p>

<h2 id=""sea-travel"">Sea travel</h2>

<p>Due to the coronavirus situation sea travel options may be more limited than previously.  If you intend to leave Thailand and need to use a boat service to reach your airport you should check with your provider.</p>

<p>There are numerous passenger boat services operating between the mainland and islands. There have been some sinkings and collisions which have resulted in fatalities, including British nationals. These incidents are usually due to overloading and/or poor maintenance, but also due to rough seas, particularly during local monsoon season.</p>

<p>During the Full Moon parties, speedboats to and from Koh Phangan are often overloaded. Take care at all times and avoid travelling by sea when conditions are rough or on vessels that are clearly overloaded or in poor condition. Make sure life jackets are available and check local weather conditions before travelling.</p>

<h2 id=""adventurous-activities-and-swimming"">Adventurous activities and swimming</h2>

<p>Check that your insurance covers you for any activities.</p>

<p>Extreme sports, including bungee jumping can be dangerous. Make sure the company is using the most up-to-date equipment and safety features, and that they are fully licensed and insured.</p>

<p>When jungle trekking use a reliable, licensed tour guide. Elephant treks and rides can be dangerous, especially when the elephants are mistreated or not handled properly. Foreign tourists, including British nationals, have been killed and seriously injured when handlers have lost control of their elephants.</p>

<p>Take particular care when swimming off coastal areas, especially during monsoon season. Strong riptides have drowned people in several areas including Phuket, Koh Chang, Hua Hin, Cha-am, Rayong, Pattaya and the Koh Samui archipelago. Always comply with warning signs, especially red flags, and only swim from approved beaches.</p>

<p>Jellyfish can swim close to the shore, particularly during the rainy season. Their sting can be fatal. If in doubt take local advice from hotel management and dive centres.</p>

<p>Take care when swimming, diving, kayaking or white water rafting in rivers or close to waterfalls, particularly in the rainy season. Currents can be extremely strong.</p>

<p>The standards maintained by diving schools and rescue services are not always as high as in the UK. Check a dive operator’s credentials carefully before using them and make sure you’re covered by your insurance. If you’ve had no previous diving experience ask your dive operator to explain what cover they offer before signing up for a course. Make sure safety equipment is available on the boat, particularly oxygen.</p>

<p>You should also ask about contingency plans which should include the ability to call for help while at sea and to evacuate divers to the nearest hyperbaric chamber if necessary.</p>

<h2 id=""travellers-with-limited-mobility"">Travellers with limited mobility</h2>
<p>There are many interesting places in Thailand that are accessible to all people. But wheelchair access is often limited due to uneven paving, street furniture and a lack of lifts, ramps, etc. This includes buses, public transit systems, and many taxis have limited storage space for wheelchairs. See our general information on <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-for-disabled-people"">planning a safe trip for disabled travellers</a>.</p>
","<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Thailand.</p>

</div>

<p>Bomb and grenade attacks have been indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. You should take care, particularly in public places, follow the advice of the local authorities and monitor local media reports. The Thai authorities have on a number of occasions warned of the possibility of attacks to coincide with symbolic dates or holidays.</p>

<p>In the past, there have been attacks in Bangkok and other parts of the country:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On 2 August 2019, coinciding with the ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ meeting, a number of small explosions occurred in Bangkok.</li>
  <li>On 10 March 2019, a number of small explosions occurred in Satun City and in Patthalung Province in the south of Thailand.</li>
  <li>In December 2018, there were a series of small explosions on Samila beach in Songkhla City.</li>
  <li>In April and May 2017, there were several explosions in Bangkok.</li>
  <li>In August 2016, there were multiple explosions and incidents in tourist areas across Thailand (including Hua Hin, Trang, Krabi, Nakhon Sri Thammarat, Patong and Loma in Phuket, Surat Thani, and Khao Lak in Phang Nga) involving improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and incendiary devices.</li>
  <li>A large bomb exploded at the Erawan Shrine in Bangkok in 2015, resulting in numerous casualties, including the death of a British national.</li>
</ul>

<p>In October 2016, the Thai authorities say they disrupted planned attacks in Bangkok.</p>

<p>The FCDO advise against all but essential travel to Thailand’s southernmost provinces of Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat, and to southern Songkhla province. There are regular attacks in these areas. On 5 November 2019, an attack against a security checkpoint in Yala province resulted in 15 deaths. Methods of attack can include arson, bombings and shootings. Targets have included civilians and members of the security forces, government offices, tourist hotels, discos, bars, shops, marketplaces, supermarkets, schools, transport infrastructure and trains. Over 7,700 people, including civilians, have been killed and several thousand more injured since 2004.</p>

<p>Martial law has been in place in nearly all areas within these provinces since 2006. The security authorities can detain suspects without charge, censor the media, conduct searches and seize documents.</p>

<p>There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.</p>
","<p>The British Embassy in Bangkok has produced a short video on <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/ukinthailand/videos/2132346856805703/"">Facebook</a> and <a rel=""external"" href=""https://twitter.com/ukinthailand/status/1002378124200329216"">Twitter</a> about some important things to be aware of when living or travelling in Thailand.</p>

<h3 id=""detention-facilities"">Detention facilities</h3>
<p>Conditions in prisons and other detention facilities in Thailand are harsh, with limited access to healthcare. There have been recent cases of detainees dying in custody.</p>

<h3 id=""drugs"">Drugs</h3>
<p>Don’t become involved with drugs of any kind. Possession of even very small quantities can lead to imprisonment. If you are found guilty of possession of marijuana you could receive a long prison sentence and/or a heavy fine. If you’re found guilty of being in possession of 20 grams of a Class A drug on exiting Thailand you risk receiving the death penalty.  Amphetamines and ecstasy are regarded as Class A drugs and possession or trafficking carries the same penalty as heroin.</p>

<h3 id=""smoking"">Smoking</h3>
<p>It is illegal to import more than 200 cigarettes per person into Thailand. This is enforced at customs on arrival. Those who exceed the limit may be fined ten times the value of the items and face confiscation of the cigarettes.</p>

<p>In January 2018, Thai authorities introduced a smoking ban on some beaches, including in Koh Samui, Pattaya and in Phuket, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Chon Buri and Songkhla provinces. Those caught smoking in non-designated areas face a 100,000 baht fine or up to a year in prison. There are also strict rules on the disposal of all forms of waste, especially polystyrene and plastic, and any act that can cause damage to coastal areas. You should follow local guidance.</p>

<p>On 27 March 2020 the Thai Department of Disease Control linked the smoking of cigarettes to the impact of coronavirus. Smoking in public could result in a fine of up to 5,000 Baht. This includes electronic cigarettes which are illegal in Thailand and their use may incur further fines or imprisonment. Electronic cigarettes are already illegal in Thailand and their use may incur further fines or imprisonment.</p>

<p>Vaporisers (like e-cigarettes and e-baraku) and refills are illegal in Thailand. These items may be confiscated and you could be fined or sent to prison for up to 10 years if convicted. Their sale or supply is also banned and you could face a heavy fine or up to 5 years imprisonment if found guilty.</p>

<h3 id=""lgbt"">LGBT</h3>
<p>Thailand is generally a tolerant and progressive place for LGBT travellers, although in parts of Thai society LGBT rights and issues are more tolerated than accepted. There are active LGBT communities and social venues and increasingly people from the LGBT community play high profile roles in the public sphere, including trans-MPs.</p>

<p>Same-sex relationships are not criminalised by law. Thailand has no legislation on same-sex marriage and same-sex marriages conducted elsewhere aren’t recognised. Those wishing to change their gender marker on official documents can do so from male to female or vice versa, provided that they have undergone, or attempted to undergo, gender reassignment surgery. Thailand does not recognise a third gender. See our <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice"">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT community.</p>

<h3 id=""wildlife"">Wildlife</h3>
<p>Thailand is a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). It’s illegal to buy, sell, kill or capture any protected wild animal or trade its parts without a licence and the ivory trade is banned.</p>
","<p>This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.</p>

<p>The Thai authorities set and enforce entry rules.  For further information <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk"">contact their embassy, high commission or consulate</a>.</p>

<p>You may also check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.</p>

<h3 id=""if-youre-not-vaccinated"">If you’re not vaccinated</h3>

<p>Travellers from all countries who are not fully vaccinated must quarantine at a State Quarantine or <a rel=""external"" href=""https://thaiembdc.org/asq/"">Alternative State Quarantine (ASQ) facility</a>. You will not be allowed to leave your room except for medical treatment or COVID-19 tests.</p>

<p>You may be required to download the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.thaichana.com/"">Thai Chana COVID-19 tracking  app</a> when you arrive.</p>

<h3 id=""if-you-usually-live-in-thailand"">If you usually live in Thailand</h3>

<p>If you have a Thai resident visa and usually live in Thailand but you cannot return within the required year, the Thailand authorities will grant you an extension to your compulsory return deadline. You must  return to Thailand as soon as you can.</p>

<h3 id=""visas"">Visas</h3>

<p>You need a valid visa to stay in Thailand. If you do not have a valid visa you will have to pay overstay penalties. You should speak to your local Immigration Office or visit the  <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.immigration.go.th/"">Thai Immigration website</a>.</p>

<p>You are legally required to have a valid passport in Thailand. If your passport expires, your visa will become invalid . If you need to renew or apply for a new British passport, see <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports"">Overseas British passport applications</a>.</p>

<p>If you cannot renew or change your visa and are not able to travel to the UK (because the border is closed, for example) <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.contact-embassy.service.gov.uk/?country=Thailand&amp;post=British%20Embassy%20Bangkok"">contact the British Embassy in Bangkok</a>.</p>

<h2 id=""regular-entry-requirements"">Regular entry requirements</h2>

<h3 id=""passport-validity"">Passport validity</h3>
<p>Your passport must have at least 6 months’ validity remaining from your date of entry into Thailand. You may be refused entry to Thailand if your passport is damaged or has pages missing.</p>

<p>If you’re a dual national, you must leave Thailand on the same passport you used to enter.  If you don’t, you may experience difficulties as you pass through immigration.</p>

<h3 id=""visas-1"">Visas</h3>
<p>For current information on entry and visa requirements refer to <a href=""/foreign-travel-advice/thailand/entry-requirements#entry-rules-in-response-to-coronavirus"">Entry rules in response to coronavirus</a>.</p>

<p>Under normal circumstances, British passport holders arriving by air or land can enter Thailand for 30 days without a visa (a ‘visa exemption’). If you need to stay longer, you can extend your stay once for up to 30 days. You must apply for the extension before your visa exemption period ends.</p>

<p>You can enter Thailand through a land border using the 30-day visa exemption 2 times in one year. If you need to enter by land more than this, you’ll need to get the appropriate visa before you travel. For more information, contact the nearest Thai embassy or consulate.</p>

<p>If you plan to stay for more than 30 days or you will work in Thailand. you must get the appropriate visa before you travel</p>

<p>The only legal way to get a new visa, entry permit or extension of stay is from a Thai Embassy or Consulate, an Immigration Officer when you enter Thailand, or one of the Immigration Offices around the country. Visas issued by visa shops, travel agents or by any other means are likely to be illegal and lead to criminal proceedings.</p>

<p>If you stay beyond the period of your visa (‘overstay’), you’ll be fined 500 baht per day  up to a maximum of 20,000 baht.  You also risk being held in detention, fined, deported at your own expense and banned from re-entering Thailand. The enforcement of penalties for overstaying is strict and conditions in detention centres can be harsh. Deportation by the Thai authorities can be a lengthy process and you will also be banned from re-entering Thailand for up to 10 years.</p>

<p>If you’re living or staying in Thailand on a long-term visa, immigration rules can be complex and are subject to change. It is your responsibility to ensure you meet the requirements of your visa. Stay informed and contact your local immigration office for more information.</p>

<h3 id=""proof-of-onward-travel-and-funds"">Proof of onward travel and funds</h3>
<p>Immigration officials in Thailand may ask you for proof of onward travel (eg a return or onward air ticket). You should make all reservations before travelling to Thailand. Some airlines have refused to board passengers without evidence of onward travel.</p>

<p>Immigration officials may also ask for evidence of adequate finances and have refused entry to people who could not show this. This is not defined in law and can be interpreted in a number of ways.</p>

<h3 id=""employment"">Employment</h3>
<p>To work in Thailand you will need a work permit or business visa. Failure to follow this rule can lead to arrest and deportation.</p>

<h3 id=""travel-safety"">Travel safety</h3>

<p>The <abbr title=""Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office"">FCDO</abbr> travel advice helps you make your own decisions about foreign travel. Your safety is our main concern, but we can’t provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you’re concerned about whether or not it’s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you’re travelling to, together with information from other sources you’ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it’s safe for you to travel.</p>

<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we’ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice"">Read more about how the <abbr title=""Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office"">FCDO</abbr> assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>
